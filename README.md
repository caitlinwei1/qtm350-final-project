# How Economic Development and Educational Attainment Impact Female Fertility Rate

## Overview
This project examines how economic development and education levels influence female fertility rates, focusing on adolescent fertility and total fertility rates. Using World Bank data, the analysis applies Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and Ridge regression to explore the relationships between GDP per capita, school enrollment rates, and fertility indicators across four regions: Eastern and Southern Africa, North America, East Asia & Pacific, and the European Union.

## Dataset
The dataset includes:
- **Adolescent Fertility Rate**: Births per 1,000 women aged 15-19.
- **Total Fertility Rate**: Average number of children per woman.
- **GDP per Capita**: Economic output per person in USD.
- **School Enrollment Rates**: Female enrollment percentages for primary, secondary, and tertiary education.

## Usage
1. Run `data_cleaning.py` to preprocess the dataset.
2. Execute `data_analysis.py` for trend analysis and visualizations.
3. Use `regression_analysis.py` to perform regression and interpret relationships.

Outputs include visualizations in `output/plots` and regression summaries.

## Results
- **Education Impact**: Secondary and tertiary enrollments strongly reduce adolescent fertility.
- **Economic Influence**: Higher GDP per capita correlates with lower fertility rates.
- **Regional Disparities**: Africa shows the highest fertility rates, while North America and the EU have the lowest.
